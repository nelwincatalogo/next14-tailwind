Key improvements:

1. Feature-First Organization:

   - Each feature (marketplace, character, account) becomes a self-contained module
   - Easier to maintain and scale individual features
   - Better separation of concerns

2. Improved Component Structure:

   - Clear separation between common, layout, and UI components
   - Better reusability and maintainability

3. Dedicated Providers Directory:

   - Centralized location for all context providers
   - Better organization of Web3 and app-level providers

4. Enhanced State Management:

   - Organized store structure with slices
   - Clear separation between global and feature-specific state

5. Better Type Organization:
   - Centralized types directory for shared types
   - Feature-specific types kept with features
